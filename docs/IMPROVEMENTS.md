This document tracks the key improvements made to enhance the Facebook Ads MCP Server's functionality and user experience.

## 🚀 Recent Improvements

### 🎯 **Multi-Dimensional Breakdown Implementation (December 2024)**
**Problem Solved**: When users requested multiple breakdowns (e.g., campaign + date, age + placement), the system would only show the first breakdown dimension or create duplicate sections, missing critical multi-dimensional insights.

**Critical Issues Fixed**:
- **Duplicate Output Bug**: Multiple `if` statements caused the same data to appear in different sections
- **Missing Multi-Dimensional Display**: Campaign + Date requests only showed daily totals, not campaign performance within each day
- **Incomplete Breakdown Support**: Users requesting age + date or placement + date combinations saw incomplete results

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Fixed routing logic (lines 98-104)
if (breakdownFields.includes('date_start')) {
  responseText += formatTimeBasedBreakdown(insightsData, breakdownFields);
} else {
  responseText += formatGenericBreakdown(insightsData, breakdownFields);
}

// New formatTimeBasedBreakdown function (lines 136-183)
function formatTimeBasedBreakdown(data, breakdownFields) {
  const nonTimeFields = breakdownFields.filter(f => !['date_start', 'date_stop'].includes(f));
  
  if (nonTimeFields.length === 0) {
    return formatDailyBreakdown(data); // Pure daily breakdown
  }
  
  // Multi-dimensional: group by date, show other dimensions within each day
  const dateGroups = groupBy(data, 'date_start');
  let responseText = `📅 **Daily Performance by ${nonTimeFields.join(' × ')}:**\n\n`;
  
  Object.keys(dateGroups).sort().forEach(date => {
    responseText += `**${date}:**\n`;
    dateGroups[date].forEach(row => {
      const dimensions = nonTimeFields
        .map(field => `${field}: ${row[field]}`)
        .join(', ');
      responseText += `  ${dimensions} - ${formatRowMetrics(row, '').replace(/\n/g, ', ')}\n`;
    });
  });
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **True Multi-Dimensional Support**: Campaign + Date shows campaign performance within each day
- ✅ **No More Duplicate Sections**: Fixed if/else if logic prevents duplicate output
- ✅ **Handles All Fundamental Combinations**: Campaign+Date, Age+Date, Placement+Date, etc.
- ✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Single dimension breakdowns still work perfectly
- ✅ **Clean Output Format**: Organized, readable multi-dimensional data display

### 🧹 **Code Cleanup & Simplification (December 2024)**
**Problem Solved**: The `get-account-insights.js` file had grown to 560+ lines with complex "Universal Event Detection Logic" that was solving non-existent problems and making the code hard to maintain.

**Issues Removed**:
- Complex event name mappings and adset configuration fetching
- "Universal Event Detection" system that nobody requested
- Async functions without await statements
- Missing null/undefined guards in data handling

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Before: 560+ lines with complex event detection
// After: ~250 lines focused on core functionality

// 1. Removed unnecessary async declaration
function formatInsightsWithBreakdowns(insightsData, level, requestParams) {

// 2. Added proper null safety
function formatRowMetrics(row, indent = '') {
  if (!row) return text;
  if (row.spend != null) text += `${indent}💰 Spend: $${parseFloat(row.spend || 0).toFixed(2)}\n`;

// 3. Simple insights formatter for basic requests
function formatSimpleInsights(insightsData) {
  if (!insightsData || insightsData.length === 0) {
    return 'No data available.\n';
  }
  // ... clean, focused formatting
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Reduced complexity from 560 to 250 lines
- ✅ Removed solving non-existent problems  
- ✅ Added proper error handling and null safety
- ✅ Faster performance (no unnecessary API calls)
- ✅ Easier to maintain and debug
- ✅ All tests still pass - no functionality lost

**Core Principle**: Keep the auto-conversions enhancement (solves real Facebook API quirk) while removing unnecessary complexity.

## 🚀 Previous Improvements

### 1. **Automatic Conversions Field Enhancement** 
**Problem Solved**: Custom conversion events (like `start_trial`) were missing from API responses when only requesting the `actions` field, leading to incomplete conversion tracking and inaccurate CPA calculations.

**Implementation** (`src/tools/get-account-insights.js:107-122`):
```javascript
// Automatically include 'conversions' when 'actions' is requested
let enhancedFields = [...fields];
if (fields.includes('actions') && !fields.includes('conversions')) {
  enhancedFields.push('conversions');
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Captures all conversion events including custom events
- ✅ Prioritizes higher-fidelity conversion data over action data
- ✅ Ensures accurate trial/purchase tracking for optimization
- ✅ Backwards compatible - no changes needed to existing requests

### 2. **Time Increment Support for Daily Breakdowns**
**Problem Solved**: Daily performance breakdowns were not available - API returned aggregated data for the entire date range instead of day-by-day metrics.

**Implementation** (`src/utils/validation.js:30` & `src/schemas/tool-schemas.js:118-121`):
```javascript
time_increment: z.union([z.string(), z.number()]).optional()
```

**Usage Examples**:
- `time_increment: 1` → Daily breakdown
- `time_increment: 7` → Weekly breakdown
- `time_increment: "monthly"` → Monthly breakdown

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Enables true daily performance tracking
- ✅ Supports trend analysis over time
- ✅ Allows for date-based optimization decisions
- ✅ Compatible with all aggregation levels (account, campaign, ad)

### 3. **Enhanced Breakdown Response Formatting**
**Problem Solved**: Breakdown results (placement, demographics, etc.) were not properly formatted, showing raw API data instead of organized insights.

**Implementation** (`src/tools/get-account-insights.js:254-516`):
- Automatic detection of breakdown dimensions
- Specialized formatters for different breakdown types:
  - `formatDailyBreakdown()` - Chronological daily performance
  - `formatPlacementBreakdown()` - Performance by ad placement
  - `formatDemographicBreakdown()` - Age/gender segmentation
  - `formatGenericBreakdown()` - Other breakdown types

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clear, organized presentation of multi-dimensional data
- ✅ Automatic aggregation of metrics by breakdown dimension
- ✅ Conversion tracking within each breakdown segment
- ✅ Sorted results by performance (spend/conversions)

### 4. **Debug Information in Responses**
**Problem Solved**: Difficult to troubleshoot why certain fields or enhancements weren't working as expected.

**Implementation** (`src/tools/get-account-insights.js:111-122`):
```javascript
const debugInfo = {
  originalFields: fields,
  includesActions: fields.includes('actions'),
  includesConversions: fields.includes('conversions'),
  willEnhance: fields.includes('actions') && !fields.includes('conversions'),
  enhancedFields: enhancedFields
};
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Transparent view of field enhancement logic
- ✅ Easy verification of API parameters
- ✅ Simplified troubleshooting for users
- ✅ Clear audit trail of modifications
