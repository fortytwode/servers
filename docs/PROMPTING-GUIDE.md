# Facebook Ads MCP Server - AI Prompting Guide

This guide helps AI assistants effectively use the Facebook Ads MCP Server tools to provide accurate, comprehensive analysis without making incorrect assumptions about API limitations.

## üéØ Key Principle: Don't Assume API Limitations

**The Facebook Ads API is highly capable**. Most breakdown and analysis requests that seem reasonable are actually possible. When in doubt, try the API call rather than assuming it won't work.

## üìä Comprehensive Breakdown Capabilities

### ‚úÖ **What IS Possible**

#### **Demographics Analysis**
```javascript
// Get age/gender breakdown for ANY campaign type
{
  "act_id": "act_589039875116261",
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "campaign_name"],
  "level": "campaign",
  "breakdowns": ["age", "gender"],
  "action_breakdowns": ["action_type"],
  "date_preset": "last_30d"
}
```
**Result**: Age and gender performance for each individual campaign, including prospecting campaigns.

#### **Placement Analysis**
```javascript
// Get placement breakdown for ANY campaign type
{
  "act_id": "act_589039875116261", 
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "campaign_name"],
  "level": "campaign",
  "breakdowns": ["placement"],
  "action_breakdowns": ["action_type"],
  "date_preset": "last_30d"
}
```
**Result**: Feed, Stories, Reels performance for each individual campaign, including prospecting campaigns.

#### **Daily Performance Analysis**
```javascript
// Get TRUE daily breakdown (not estimated)
{
  "act_id": "act_589039875116261",
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "date_start", "date_stop"],
  "level": "campaign", // or "account", "adset", "ad"
  "time_increment": 1,
  "date_preset": "last_30d"
}
```
**Result**: Actual daily performance data, not aggregated estimates.

#### **Combined Breakdowns**
```javascript
// Multiple breakdowns simultaneously
{
  "act_id": "act_589039875116261",
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "campaign_name"],
  "level": "ad",
  "breakdowns": ["age", "placement"],
  "action_breakdowns": ["action_type"],
  "date_preset": "last_7d"
}
```
**Result**: Age groups by placement performance for each ad.

### ‚ùå **Common Incorrect Assumptions**

1. **"Prospecting campaigns don't have demographic data"** ‚Üí FALSE
   - All campaigns report demographics if targeting allows

2. **"Daily data is only estimated splits"** ‚Üí FALSE  
   - Use `time_increment: 1` for true daily breakdown

3. **"Placement data not available for custom audiences"** ‚Üí FALSE
   - Placement data available regardless of targeting method

4. **"Can't get conversion breakdowns"** ‚Üí FALSE
   - Use `action_breakdowns: ["action_type"]` for conversion breakdowns

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Usage Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Campaign Type Analysis**

Instead of assuming limitations, filter results by campaign naming patterns:

```javascript
// Get all campaigns first
{
  "act_id": "act_589039875116261",
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "campaign_name"],
  "level": "campaign",
  "breakdowns": ["age", "gender"], // or ["placement"]
  "date_preset": "last_30d"
}

// Then filter in analysis:
// - Prospecting: campaigns containing "Prospecting", "Interest", etc.
// - Retargeting: campaigns containing "Retargeting", "RT", "LAL", etc.
```

### **Pattern 2: Multi-Dimensional Analysis**

```javascript
// Step 1: Get demographic breakdown
{
  "breakdowns": ["age", "gender"],
  "action_breakdowns": ["action_type"]
}

// Step 2: Get placement breakdown  
{
  "breakdowns": ["placement"],
  "action_breakdowns": ["action_type"]
}

// Step 3: Combine insights in analysis
```

### **Pattern 3: Time-Series Analysis**

```javascript
// Daily trends
{
  "time_increment": 1,
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "date_start"]
}

// Weekly trends
{
  "time_increment": 7,
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "date_start"]
}
```

## üîç Diagnostic Approach

### **When Analysis Seems Limited:**

1. **Check the actual API response** in the raw data
2. **Look for breakdown fields** in the response
3. **Verify if data exists but wasn't processed** in formatting
4. **Try different breakdown combinations** rather than assuming unavailable

### **Common Data Availability Issues:**

```javascript
// If no demographic data appears:
// 1. Check if campaigns have sufficient volume for privacy thresholds
// 2. Verify campaigns are actually running (not paused)
// 3. Check date range - very recent data may be delayed

// If no placement data appears:  
// 1. Check if automatic placements are enabled
// 2. Verify campaigns are using placement optimization
// 3. Look for placement data at ad level instead of campaign level
```

## üìã Analysis Templates

### **Complete Campaign Performance Report**

```javascript
// Base performance
{
  "level": "campaign",
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "campaign_name", "impressions", "clicks"],
  "date_preset": "last_30d"
}

// Demographics
{
  "level": "campaign", 
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "campaign_name"],
  "breakdowns": ["age", "gender"],
  "action_breakdowns": ["action_type"],
  "date_preset": "last_30d"
}

// Placements
{
  "level": "campaign",
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "campaign_name"], 
  "breakdowns": ["placement"],
  "action_breakdowns": ["action_type"],
  "date_preset": "last_30d"
}

// Daily trends
{
  "level": "campaign",
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "campaign_name", "date_start"],
  "time_increment": 1,
  "date_preset": "last_30d"
}
```

### **Creative Performance Analysis**

```javascript
// Use facebook_get_ad_creatives tool for:
// - Top performing ad creatives with thumbnails
// - Performance correlation by visual elements
// - Creative type analysis (video vs image)

// Combined with insights:
{
  "level": "ad",
  "fields": ["spend", "actions", "conversions", "ad_name"],
  "breakdowns": ["placement"],
  "action_breakdowns": ["action_type"]
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

### **For AI Assistants:**

1. **Always try the API call first** before stating something is not possible
2. **Use the actual tool responses** to determine what data is available
3. **Look at the raw API response** when formatting seems limited
4. **Combine multiple breakdown calls** for comprehensive analysis
5. **Filter results programmatically** rather than assuming API limitations

### **Data Quality Notes:**

- **Privacy Thresholds**: Facebook may hide demographic data for small audiences
- **Attribution Windows**: Conversion data may vary by attribution setting
- **Reporting Delays**: Very recent data (last 24-48 hours) may be incomplete
- **Campaign Types**: All campaign types support the same breakdown capabilities

### **Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. Check if the issue is in data availability or response formatting
2. Try different aggregation levels (account ‚Üí campaign ‚Üí adset ‚Üí ad)
3. Verify date ranges and attribution windows
4. Look for data in both `actions` and `conversions` fields
5. Check if breakdown dimensions appear in raw API response
